2D Solid Solver

Purpose:
    Solve arbitrary 2D solid structure for:
        Nodal Displacements
        Element Strains
        Element Stresses

To run:
    u, strain, stress = truss2D(nodes_file, elements_file, displacements_file, forces_file, index)

Inputs:
    nodes_file: ordered file containing nodal coordinates with the nth row: [node #, xn, yn, zn]
                The first line should say the # of nodes
    elements_file: connectivity file of the form [ele #, node1, node2, node3]
                The first line should read [Total Elements, E, nu]
    displacements_file: displacment BC file of the form [node, dof, value]
    forces_file: force BC file of the form [node, dof, value]
    index: 0,1 index base of the input files. Default 0

Outputs:
    u: nodal displacements
    strain: element strains
    stress: element strains
