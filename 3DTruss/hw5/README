3D Truss Solver

Purpose:
    Solve arbitrary 3D truss structure for:
        Nodal Displacements
        Nodal Forces
        Element Forces
        Element Strains

To run:
    u = truss2D(nodes_file, elements_file, displacements_file, forces_file, index)

Inputs:
    nodes_file: ordered file containing nodal coordinates with the nth row: [xn, yn]
    elements_file: connectivity file of the form [node1, node2 E, A]
    displacements_file: displacment BC file of the form [node, dof, value]
    forces_file: force BC file of the form [node, dof, value]
    index: 0,1 index base of the input files. Default 0

Outputs:
    u: nodal displacements
    eps: element strains
    stress: internal stresses
    fi: internal forces
    fe: nodal forces
